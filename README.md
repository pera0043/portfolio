Final Projectâ€“Web Portfolio

### Process
I started with creating the html structure of home page then moved to other pages. Copied most of the code from bootstrap for the webpages and did changes by adding/removing necessary styles according to my wesite design. Added CSS variables to customize the default colour scheme and added my our color theme. Gave styles to nav bar select hover and active states. 
Added header and the gradient image that i have used in the website from CSS. all from two sizes for desktop and mobile. Added extra project work in the portfolio page to show more work that I have done.

### Challenges faced during development and how you overcame those changes
The icon images i used throughout the website was blurred when i added them evan though i added high quality icons it didn't seem to work. my last option was to add svg icons. should have added svg's in the begining that would have saved lot of time for me. It also took me few hours of googling to figure out how to link the homepage to the logo, turns out its not that hard. You just have to add the logo img inside a atag and link the html page. The issue that I wasn't ablt to solve on my own was some of the website sections not being responsive for larger screens. I spent lot of time trying to figure that out but didnt work. So Prof Abhay went through the code and was able to help fix the issue. Thank you for the guidence throughout the Semestar.
