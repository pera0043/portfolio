Final Project–Web Portfolio

### Process
I started with creating the html structure of home page then moved to other pages. Copied most of the code from bootstrap for the webpages and added new HTML and did changes by adding/removing necessary styles according to my wesite design. Added CSS variables to customize the default colour scheme and added my own color theme. Gave styles to nav bar select hover and active states. Added header and the gradient image that i have used in the website from CSS. all from two sizes for desktop and mobile. Added extra project work in the portfolio page to show more work that I have done. after completing the look and feel of the website I added CSS animations and hover through CSS Libraries. Added skip links to all pages and to all content section of each page. Added aria codes where necessary. I haven't added schema because i dont want to include my address or contact number on my website, I would prefer clients reaching me through the contact form or email, my linkedin/behance work profiles. Which I have added in the footer section.

### Challenges faced during development and how you overcame those changes
The icon images i used throughout the website was blurred when i added them evan though i added high quality icons it didn't seem to work. my last option was to add svg icons. should have added svg's in the begining that would have saved lot of time for me. It also took me few hours of googling to figure out how to link the homepage to the logo, turns out its not that hard. You just have to add the logo img inside a atag and link the html page. The issue that I wasn't ablt to solve on my own was some of the website sections not being responsive for larger screens. I spent lot of time trying to figure that out but didnt work. So Prof Abhay went through the code and was able to help fix the issue. Thank you for the guidence throughout the Semestar. 

### What have you learned by creating your web portfolio
Beginning of the semester I only knew to code using HTML and CSS from scratch. But by doing the portfolio website from bootstrap I realized that I don’t need to type code from scratch. I can copy the code that is given and can adjust the layout the way we want by adding classes. This also saved a lot of time spent trying to type the right code from the begining. Learning to use CSS Variables to customize the colors of the website was very useful, and it made my work trouble-free. Definitely liked using less code on the CSS to achieve different styles by using CSS frameworks such as animate.css and hover.css. It gave my website a fresh look. Now that I am familiar with bootstrap I would prefer to use bootstrap from now onwards to develop websites.
