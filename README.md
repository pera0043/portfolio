Final Projectâ€“Web Portfolio

### Process
I started with creating the html structure of home page then moved to other pages. Copied most of the code from bootstrap for the webpages and did changes by adding/removing necessary styles according to my wesite design. Added CSS variables to customize the default colour scheme and added my our color theme. Gave styles to nav bar select hover and active states.
